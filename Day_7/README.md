Object.values()
The Object.values() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. (The only difference is that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well.)
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:

string
number
boolean
null
undefined
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).
